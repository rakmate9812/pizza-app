# Pizza App

This is a full-stack web application showcasing my current skills. The app consists of the following components:

- An Azure MS SQL database with a server
- A back-end application using ASP.NET 8, connecting with EntityFramework to the database (Code-First approach), and web APIs
- A front-end application using Vue 2, Typescript, Routing, and smaller frameworks for design

## Overview

The application aims to be a review-based web app, allowing users to upload reviews of the pizzas they've eaten. Other users can browse these reviews and view them in detail.

## Features

- **Azure MS SQL Database:** The app utilizes an Azure MS SQL database to store pizza reviews.

- **ASP.NET 8 Back-end:** The back-end is built using ASP.NET 8, connecting to the database using EntityFramework with a Code-First approach. It also exposes web APIs.

- **Vue 2 Front-end:** The front-end is developed using Vue 2, incorporating Typescript, Routing, and smaller design frameworks.

## Important notes
- The appsettings.json file is ignored from the repo, I decided not to mess with storing keys and passwords in vaults, just writing them in the settings, and exclude it from the project
- If someone wants to run the application, contact me on github or e-mail
